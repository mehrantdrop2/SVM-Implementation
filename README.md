## 📄 Overview

In this repository, you will find two main types of SVM implementations:

1. **SVM with scikit-learn**: Utilize the powerful scikit-learn library to implement standard SVM models quickly and efficiently.
2. **SVM from Scratch**: Challenge yourself by building SVM models from the ground up, gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics. You will also become familiar with the CVXOPT library.

## 🌟 Features

We cover a range of scenarios and advanced topics in SVM, including:

- **Kernel SVMs**: Explore the use of different kernels such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to understand how they influence the decision boundaries of the SVM.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Learn how to extend the binary classification capability of SVM to handle multiple classes, which is essential for dealing with more complex datasets.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating SVM implementations using scikit-learn and from scratch.
  - `svm_sklearn.ipynb`: SVM implementation using scikit-learn.
  - `svm_scratch.ipynb`: SVM implementation from scratch using CVXOPT.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for SVM implementations.
  - `svm_sklearn.py`: SVM implementation using scikit-learn.
  - `svm_scratch.py`: SVM implementation from scratch using CVXOPT.
- `data/`: Example datasets used in the implementations.
- `images/`: Visualizations and images used in the README and notebooks.


## 📈 Usage

- **SVM with scikit-learn**:
  - Quickly implement SVM models with minimal code.
  - Experiment with different kernels and hyperparameters.
