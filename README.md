## 📄 Overview

In this repository, you will find two main types of SVM implementations:

1. **SVM with scikit-learn**: Utilize the powerful scikit-learn library to implement standard SVM models quickly and efficiently.
2. **SVM from Scratch**: Challenge yourself by building SVM models from the ground up, gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics. You will also become familiar with the CVXOPT library.

## 🌟 Features

We cover a range of scenarios and advanced topics in SVM, including:

- **Kernel SVMs**: Explore the use of different kernels such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to understand how they influence the decision boundaries of the SVM.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Learn how to extend the binary classification capability of SVM to handle multiple classes, which is essential for dealing with more complex datasets.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.
- `SVM_fully from scratch (Helper).pdf`: A detailed PDF guide to understanding and implementing SVM from scratch.
- `SVM_implementation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of SVM using scikit-learn and from scratch.
- `evaluate.py`: A Python script to evaluate the performance of the SVM models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shining0611armor/svm-implementations.git
